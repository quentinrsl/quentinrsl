- 👋 Hi, I’m Quentin Roussel
- 👀 I’m interested in maths, computer science, and their applications to the real world. I'm always looking forward to discover new subjects and work in domains that I'm unfamiliar with. 
- 🌱 I'm currently a computer science student at Télécom Paris in France.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving computer science. This includes research projects, developping applications, contributing to small or big projects.
